## ADD SALSA
1. “Add salsa” will be used to take deposits that are not refundable and goes into a pool that is used to invest into other investments (DaaS) and the user gets rewarded with their share of rewards from the investment into their rewards balance in the main balance above.

2. When the investment returns are deposited back into the contract, these rewards are sent to the main dapp. They are credited to each user as their share of the salsa share. For instance, if as a user I deposit 200 BUSD into the salsa pool and the pool is then at 10,000 BUSD I would get 2% share of any investment rewards that are deposited back into the salsa pool from investment gains. These are sent to the user as they would show in the ‘your rewards’ of the main application.

3. Add salsa will send a 1% fee to the owners wallet upon deposit, and each time the owner deposits investment rewards 1% of those rewards go to the owners wallet. This is a fee for management and to cover gas fees.

LOTTERY
The page will have a small lottery section. A user buys a lottery ticket with one click and buys a ticket for 10 BUSD. Once 10 tickets are purchased, 50 BUSD is sent to a random winner, and 50BUSD is kept in the contract. Last lottery winner is stored and replaced each time the lottery finishes.
